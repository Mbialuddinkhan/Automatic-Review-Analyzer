# Automatic-Review-Analyzer
The purpose of this project is to create a classifier that can be used to analyze sentiment in product reviews. Our training set includes of Amazon user reviews for a variety of food products. The reviews, which were formerly offered on a 5-point scale, have been changed to a +1 or -1 scale, reflecting a favorable or bad rating.
To assess reviews automatically, we willÂ need to complete the following tasks:

Three forms of linear classifiers are implemented and compared: the perceptron method, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

Use some simple text characteristics to train your classifiers on the meal review dataset.

Experiment with different features to see how they affect classifier performance.

Details of the setup:

We'll be using Python 3.6 with some additional libraries for this project and the rest of the course. We strongly advise you to read through the NumPy tutorial and take notice of how the NumPy numerical library is used in the code provided. When it comes to numerical computation, NumPy arrays are far more efficient than Python's native arrays. Using NumPy will also save you time.

Note on software: You'll need the NumPy numerical toolbox and the matplotlib charting toolbox for this project.

Download and untar sentiment analysis.tar.gz into a working directory. The sentiment analysis folder contains the following python files: project1.py provides numerous important functions and function templates that you will use to analyse

We will use project1.py to implement our learning algorithms because it has a number of handy functions and function templates.

main.py is a skeleton script that calls these functions and allows you to conduct your experiments.

utils.py is a Python file that contains utility functions that the staff has created for you.

test.py is a Python script that tests a handful of the functions you'll use. Please keep in mind that these tests are offered to aid in the debugging of your implementation and are not necessarily indicative of the tests used for online grading. Feel free to add more test cases locally to ensure that your code is correct before submitting it to the codeboxes' online graders.
